a scope is:
- statements defined locally before here
    - including scopes 
- The previous/containing scope

type scope =
    | OuterScope of stmt list
    | Scope of stmt list * scope


when we interpret a scope:
- the current scope (Scope(lst,prev) as scp) becomes (Scope([], scp))

when we are done interpreting a scope:
- the scope is added to the current scopes (stmt)
